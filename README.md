# Description
Some C++ snippets code, to teach some C++ Tricks

* [Virtual and Constructor](virtual_init_ctor): Simple recall of overloading rules inside constructor.
* [Enum and XMacro](xmacro): Nice way to use Enum class and having operator<< and usage always sync.
* [Custom Iterator](custom_iterator): How to implement custom iterators outside of a container.  
e.g. Browse matrix elements using Hilbert, Z-Curve or Graycode indexing iterator.
* [Find Tuple](find_tuple): How many time you have a tuple T in a set S.  
e.g. T = {1,3}, S = {1,2,3,1,2,4,3,1,1,3}, You can form the tuple T three times.
* [Shared from this](shared_from_this): Good practice when using std::enable_shared_from_this
